# whoami

A minimal Helm chart wrapping the `traefik/whoami` Docker image. Also contains scripts for initializing and deleting the chart.

This directory shows a simple case of deploying our own first-party Helm chart.  Editable values are listed in `values.yaml`; for simplicity, the number of such values is limited.
