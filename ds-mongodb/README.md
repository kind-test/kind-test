# MongoDB

MongoDB and Mongo Express.

Configuration is messed up.  Don't know why what works works, don't know why what doesn't work doesn't.  Apparently, logging in with the credentials in express.yaml (need to place the password in secret files) magically turns into logging in as the root user?!  But how do I add non-root users?

This sucks.
