# Kubernetes dashboard

This directory contains files and scripts for the Kubernetes dashboard. Since the dashboard is a `minikube` addon, we do not need `init.sh` or `delete.sh` scripts and only provide a `portforward.sh` script.

Scripts:
- `portforward.sh`: Forwards the port for the Kubernetes dashboard.
